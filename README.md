# hydrophobic_moment
3D Hydrophobic moment calculator

Given a 3D SDF file, this script will return a hydrophobic moment for the molecule. Units are kTÅ/e, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temp in Kelvin, Å is Angstrom and e is charge of an electron.

**IMPORTANT**
This script relies on calculation of the coulombic surface by Chimera (UCSF) so can only be executed by the Python shell packed with Chimera.
